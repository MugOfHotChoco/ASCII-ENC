Ascii and Custom Encryption
============================
An encryption python program and library for files!

This is helpful because using a more obscure encoding method means there won't be as many decoders.
I think so anyway.
Plus there is customizable encodation so can make you own encryption dictionary.

If you just want to encrypt files, there is a pre-built base64 library so... 
You could use that. It's probably better if you don't want customizabilty.
If you still want to use this, Enjoy!
